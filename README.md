# Data-Analysis-Practice-Project

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of donations to school projects. It aims to uncover insights and answer questions about the data, such as:

Which states have the most schools involved in projects?
Which states gather the most donations on average?
What is the average donation amount?
What are the most popular project types and subject categories?
How long does it take for a project to be fully funded, and how does this vary between states?
The project uses various data analysis techniques, including merging dataframes, grouping data, calculating statistics, and creating visualizations like bar plots, scatter plots, and pie charts.
